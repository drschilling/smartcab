    "This is the report for the Train a Smartcab How to Drive project of Udacity's Nanodegree program in Machine Learning. The project consists of using reinforcement learning techniques in the form of a simple game in which the objective is to ensure that the smartcab can be trained with data from the environment, following its strict rules of traffic to reach its destination in the shortest possible time, and with the lower numbers of errors. All graphical representations are next to the project code [repository](https://github.com/drschilling/smartcab).\n"

    "### Performance metrics and rules\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that the objective of the project is to find the ideal conditions within the problem of automating a smart cab how to drive alone for this we must take into account some metrics that will ensure if the agent had good or poor performance during the course of its training. Good performance means reaching the destination within a small time interval and not miss the traffic rules as follows. \n",
    "\n",
    "###### Traffic rules\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Green traffic light:**\n",
    "Can do: Move\n",
    " / Can't do: left turn when  oncoming traffic is going forward or turning right \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Red traffic light:**\n",
    "Can do: right turn when no oncoming traffic from the left going forward\n",
    " / Can't do: Move\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Next I detail each of the metrics I used to evaluate three different stages of agent building (random actions, with Q Learning implemented and Q Learning optimized):\n",
    "\n",
    "* **time_left** : We calculate the sum of the remaining time so that the agent reaches the limit of time that he has available to reach his final destination. We can then say that agents that have a lower calculated sum reach their destiny more quickly, and therefore are more performative.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **total_penalties**: The total penalties are calculated to reveal whether the agent is following the traffic rules in the environment. Agents that accumulate large sums of penalty are indicative of taking more random actions and not having a good performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **destination_reached** : We basically indicate with ``True`` or ``False`` whether or not the agent has reached the programmed destination.\n",
    "\n",
    " ##### Exclusive for Q-Learning:\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "* **alpha**: the learning rate its a value set between 0 and 1. If we set it to 0 it means that the Q-values are never updated, hence nothing is learned. Setting a high value such as 0.9 means that learning can occur quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **epsilon**: The probability of an event should occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Random Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we implement an agent with a set of random actions ** ['forward', 'left', 'right', None]** within the four types of actions that an agent can take, where our smartcab can go forward, can turn right, turn left or take no action at all. Its implementation in the agent code ([random_agent](https://github.com/drschilling/smartcab/blob/master/smartcab/random_agent)) was as follows:"

    "\n",
    "![Image title](smartcab/results/random_table_results.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have noted above, the agent has a very poor performance with only 66% of destinations reached, and with an extremely high penalty rate with an average of 47 points per attempt. The high penalty rate is directly linked to the agent's random actions where the agent does not obey the traffic rules and has no impediment to making mistakes. The relation between destinations reached and the frequency of penalties can be observed on **Plot 1** where we observe clearly the inversely proportional relation between the penalty values and the success or not of each attempt.  \n",

    "Another indication that the agent is negatively affected by not updating the required pieces of information of its state is the low value for the time left for the agent to reach its destination as we can see according to the **Plot 2** when the high values for the time left  concurs with positive cases destination reached, something that can be justified by the agent extrapolating frequently the deadline before reaches its destiny.\n",

    "\n",
    "* High penalty values are inversely proportional to the agent's success rates in reaching its destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "* High values of time left indicate that the agent has reached its goal before the deadline, which indicates success.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the observations above, when we look at  the **Plot 3** that makes a relation between penalties and time left we can clearly observe that the two have an **inversely** proportional relation, that is, an agent who suffers from a higher level of penalties will not reach its goal within a small period of time.\n",

    "### Updating the state\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent must move within a grid space (eight columns and six rows) wherein each attempt a destination represented by a coordinate (x, y) will be assigned to it. This destination should be reached within a delta time considering the enviroment traffic rules, and if the deadline is reached it is considered that the agent failed to reach the final destination.With each new attempt to reach the destination, our agent's current state is updated by receiving a new traffic **light** rule, a new **oncoming** traffic actions, information about if there is traffic from the **right** of the agent, information about if there is traffic from the **left** of the agent, a **new waypoint position** to which it must be moved to reach the destination, and a **deadline** which will measure the amount of time that agent has to reach its destination. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this project I will not consider updating the information for **left** and **right** because I believe that these could be used in more specific situations, and the same can be obtained by updating the oncoming and lights parameters. I also will not consider **deadline** because it has a dynamic nature and decreases every time an agent moves. What means that even if my agent have encountered that particular inputs['light'], inputs['oncoming'], self.next_waypoint instance before, it would consider it a different state if the deadline is different not guaranteeing a consistency. Each of these new input data that updates the state of our agent can be explained as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Light: The agent will follow severe traffic rules depending on the state of the traffic lights which directly influence the degree of success of the agent, since obeying the traffic rules from the lights['red' or 'green'] diminishes the chance of the agent suffering unnecessary penalties.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Oncoming: Depending on the oncoming traffic the agent will take a different action regarding the state of the traffic lights as we mentioned above.The possible oncoming actions will be (None, 'left', 'right', 'forward').\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Next waypoint: The action that points the direction where the agent should move towards reaching its destination. It's the most important information to be updated if we want to guarantee that agent will have success. The possible set of values for the next waypoint is ('left', 'right','forward'). \n",

    "With your driving agent being capable of interpreting the input information and having a mapping of environmental states, your next task is to implement the Q-Learning algorithm for your driving agent to choose the best action at each time step, based on the Q-values for the current state and action. Each action taken by the smartcab will produce a reward which depends on the state of the environment. The Q-Learning driving agent will need to consider these rewards when updating the Q-values. Once implemented, set the simulation deadline enforcement enforce_deadline to True. Run the simulation and observe how the smartcab moves about the environment in each trial.\n",
